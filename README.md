Member: William Lin, Howard Chang, Joslyn Chen
### Introduction
This project aims to design and implement a Kalman Filter for estimating the pose and altitude of a quadcopter in a virtual environment. The proposed system will use sensor data fusion techniques to improve the accuracy of the quadcopter's state estimation, resulting in a more stable and robust flight control system. This project will be implemented using Python programming language, emphasizing optimizing the algorithm's performance and efficiency.


### Problem Statement
Imagine in a virtual environment with simulated sensors, the goal is to implement a Kalman Filter-based system that can accurately estimate the pose and altitude of a quadcopter. The project will focus on the following aspects:

Developing a mathematical model for the quadcopter's dynamics
Implementing a Kalman Filter for state estimation
Integrating sensor data from the virtual environment
Analyzing the performance by visualizing the estimated values from Kalman Filter compared to the ground truth data.

### Proposed method
Literature review and understanding of the Kalman Filter and its application to quadcopter state estimation.
Development of the quadcopter's mathematical model, considering the system's dynamics and kinematics.
Design and implementation of the Kalman Filter algorithm in Python.
Integration of sensor data from the virtual environment, including IMU and altitude sensor.
Testing and validating the implemented system in random flight routes within the virtual environment.
Analyze the estimation accuracy of implemented Kalman Filter.

### Expectations from the project
Through this project, we hope to gain hands-on experience in implementing the Kalman Filter and sensor fusion. To be specific, we expect to deliver a well-documented Python implementation of a Kalman Filter for quadcopter state estimation, focusing on pose and altitude. The project will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the implemented system, emphasizing its accuracy and robustness in various simulated scenarios.
