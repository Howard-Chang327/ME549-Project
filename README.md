### Extended Kalman Filter-Based Pose and Altitude Estimation for a Planner Quadcopter

Members: William Lin, Howard Chang, Joslyn Chen

### Introduction
Our project aims to design and implement an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for accurately estimating the pose and altitude of a planner quadcopter. The implementation will be done using Python programming language, with a key emphasis on the performance and efficiency of the algorithm.

### Problem Statement
In a virtual environment with simulated sensors, our goal is to develop an EKF-based system that can accurately estimate the pose and altitude of a quadcopter using noisy measurements derived from the ideal locations. The project will focus on the following aspects:

1. Developing a mathematical model encapsulating the dynamics of the quadcopter.
2. Implementing an Extended Kalman Filter for state estimation.
3. Integrating simulated sensor data, which incorporates noise into the ideal pose and altitude of the quadcopter.
4. Evaluating the performance by comparing the estimated values from the EKF with the ground truth data.

### Proposed Method
Our project will follow these sequential steps:

1. Conduct a literature review to understand the Extended Kalman Filter and its application to quadcopter state estimation.
2. Develop a mathematical model for the quadcopter, considering both dynamics and kinematics of the system.
3. Design and implement the Extended Kalman Filter algorithm using Python.
4. Generate simulated sensor data by adding noise to the ideal pose and altitude of the quadcopter.
5. Test and validate the implemented system across random flight routes within the virtual environment.
6. Analyze the estimation accuracy of the implemented Extended Kalman Filter by comparing the estimates with the ground truth data.

### Expectations from the Project
Through the course of this project, we expect to gain hands-on experience in the implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter and the application of sensor fusion techniques. Specifically, we plan to deliver a Python-based, well-documented implementation of an EKF for quadcopter state estimation, with a focus on pose and altitude. A comprehensive evaluation of the implemented system will be provided, highlighting its accuracy and robustness across various simulated scenarios.
